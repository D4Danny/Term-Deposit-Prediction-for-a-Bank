# Term-Deposit-Prediction-for-a-Bank
We have a dataset of more than 40K customers from a bank. The bank would like to know the probability or Likelyhood of their customers availing a TERM DEPOSIT based on various individual characteristics of the customer.
We used LOGISTIC REGRESSION, a Supervised Machine Learning classification algorithm to predict the probability based on various categorical dependent features.
